LeetCode 380 is a problem about designing a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

Here's the problem statement:

Implement the RandomizedSet class:

RandomizedSet() Initializes the RandomizedSet object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.
This problem can be solved using a combination of a Python dictionary (or HashMap in other languages) and a list.
 We'll use the dictionary to keep track of the existence of the values, and the list to get random elements.

Here is a Python solution:

```python
import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dict = {}
        self.list = []

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val in self.dict:
            return False
        self.dict[val] = len(self.list)
        self.list.append(val)
        return True

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val not in self.dict:
            return False
        last_element, idx = self.list[-1], self.dict[val]
        self.list[idx], self.dict[last_element] = last_element, idx
        self.list.pop()
        del self.dict[val]
        return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        return random.choice(self.list)



```

Here's how it works:

The __init__ method initializes an empty dictionary and an empty list.
The insert method checks if the value is already in the dictionary. If yes, it returns False.

If no, it adds the value to the dictionary with the value as the key and the current length of the list as the value, then appends the value to the end of the list and returns True.

The remove method checks if the value is in the dictionary. If no, it returns False. If yes, it swaps the value with the last element in the list, then removes the last element from the list and deletes the value from the dictionary, and returns True.

The getRandom method returns a random element from the list.

The time complexity of all operations is O(1) on average, because dictionary and list operations take constant time on average. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set, because we use a dictionary and a list to store the elements.
