The problem "First Unique Character in a String" from LeetCode asks for finding the index of the first non-repeating character in a given string. 

If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Here is a Python solution using a dictionary to count the characters and then finding the first unique character:

```python
def firstUniqChar(s):
    count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in count:
            count[c] += 1
        else:
            count[c] = 1

    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if count[c] == 1:
            return i
    return -1


```

In this solution, we first iterate over the string s to count the occurrences of each character. 
Then, we iterate over the string s again, and for each character, we check if its count is 1 (i.e., it's unique).
If we find a unique character, we return its index. 
If we don't find any unique character, we return -1.
