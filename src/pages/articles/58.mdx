The LeetCode problem 58, "Length of Last Word," asks us to find the length of the last word in a given string. Here's the problem statement for reference:

**Problem:** Given a string `s` consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "Hello World   "
Output: 5
```

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach that involves iterating through the string from right to left and counting the length of the last word encountered. Let's see the implementation:

```python

def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        i = len(s) - 1
        length = 0

        while s[i] == " ":
            i -= 1
        while i >= 0 and s[i] != " ":
            length += 1
            i -= 1
        return length


```

**Time Complexity:** In this approach, we iterate through the string once from right to left. In the worst case, where the string contains only non-space characters, we need to iterate through the entire string, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity of this approach is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the length and the index. We don't use any data structures that grow with the input size.

It's important to note that this approach assumes that the input string does not contain leading spaces before the last word. If there could be leading spaces, you may need to modify the approach to handle that scenario accordingly.

This simple approach efficiently solves the problem, making it an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity.
