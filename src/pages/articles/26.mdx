Problem Description:
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use two pointers: one pointer to iterate through the array, and another pointer to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers: i = 0 (for iterating the array) and j = 1 (for placing unique elements).
2. Iterate through the array starting from index 1 (since the first element is always unique).
3. If the current element (nums[i]) is equal to the previous element (nums[i-1]), move the iterator pointer (i) to the next element.
4. If the current element (nums[i]) is different from the previous element (nums[i-1]), update the next unique element position by assigning nums[j] = nums[i] and increment both pointers (i and j) by 1.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we reach the end of the array.
6. The length of the updated array will be the value of j.

Here's the Python code that implements the above algorithm:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0

    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]

    return i + 1
```

Time Complexity:
The algorithm iterates through the given array once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Space Complexity:
The algorithm modifies the array in-place without using any extra data structures. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), constant space.

Note that the length of the modified array returned by the function may be less than or equal to the length of the input array, but the actual values beyond the length of the modified array are not considered significant. The function returns the length of the modified array, and the first part of the modified array up to that length contains the unique elements.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
