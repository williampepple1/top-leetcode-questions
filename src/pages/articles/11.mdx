The LeetCode problem "Container with Most Water" (problem number 11) asks us to find the container with the most water given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls. Each integer represents the height of a wall, and the width of each wall is assumed to be 1. Here's the problem statement for reference:

**Problem:** Given n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a_i), n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, a_i) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the list, respectively. We calculate the area between the two lines formed by the pointers and update the maximum area seen so far. Then, we move the pointers inward based on the height of the walls, always trying to maximize the area.

Here's the implementation using this approach:

```python
def maxArea(height):
    max_area = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1

    while left < right:
        h = min(height[left], height[right])
        w = right - left
        area = h * w
        max_area = max(max_area, area)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return max_area
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

- We iterate through the list once using the two-pointer approach, moving the pointers inward until they meet.
- Since we process each element once, the time complexity is linear, O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of this approach is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of extra space for storing the variables `max_area`, `left`, `right`, `h`, `w`, and the function's return value. The space usage does not increase with the input size.

Hence, the space complexity is O(1).

This two-pointer approach efficiently solves the problem by finding the container with the most water, providing an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity.
