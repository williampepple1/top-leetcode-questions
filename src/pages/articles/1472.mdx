The LeetCode problem 1472, "Design Browser History," asks us to design a data structure to represent the browser history, supporting several operations. Here's the problem statement for reference:

**Problem:** You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and can visit websites. The browser history is represented as a linked list of websites, with the current page being the tail of the list. You can move back and forward through the list.

Implement the `BrowserHistory` class:
- `BrowserHistory(string homepage)`: Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
- `void visit(string url)`: Visits `url` from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
- `string back(int steps)`: Move `steps` back in history. If you can only return `x` steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only `x` steps. Return the current url after moving back in history at most `steps`.
- `string forward(int steps)`: Move `steps` forward in history. If you can only forward `x` steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only `x` steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history at most `steps`.

To solve this problem, we can use a doubly linked list to represent the browser history. We will also keep track of the current node, allowing us to navigate back and forward. Here's the implementation:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None


class BrowserHistory:
    def __init__(self, homepage):
        self.current = Node(homepage)

    def visit(self, url):
        node = Node(url)
        node.prev = self.current
        self.current.next = node
        self.current = node

    def back(self, steps):
        while self.current.prev and steps > 0:
            self.current = self.current.prev
            steps -= 1
        return self.current.url

    def forward(self, steps):
        while self.current.next and steps > 0:
            self.current = self.current.next
            steps -= 1
        return self.current.url
```

**Time Complexity:**

- The `visit` operation has a time complexity of O(1) since it involves creating a new node and updating the current node's pointers.
- The `back` operation moves back in history by updating the current node. The time complexity of this operation depends on the number of steps and the length of the history. In the worst case, where steps are greater than the length of the history, it takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the history. However, in most cases, it takes O(steps) time since we typically move back a few steps.
- The `forward` operation moves forward in history by updating the current node. Similar to the `back` operation, the time complexity depends on the number of steps and the length of the history. In the worst case, it takes O(n) time, but in most cases, it takes O(steps) time.

**Space Complexity:**

- The space complexity of the `BrowserHistory` class is O(n), where n is the number of visited websites. This is because we store each visited website as a node in the doubly linked list.

Overall, this design efficiently handles the browser history operations. The time complexity of the `back` and `forward` operations depends on the number of steps but is usually less than O(n), making it an optimal solution for typical usage scenarios.
