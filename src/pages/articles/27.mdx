Problem Description:
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use the two-pointer approach. We'll initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, both starting from the beginning of the array.

The steps to remove the element are as follows:

Initialize p1 and p2 to 0.
Iterate through the array while p2 is less than the length of the array:
If nums[p2] is not equal to val, assign nums[p2] to nums[p1] and increment p1 by 1.
Increment p2 by 1.
Return the value of p1, which represents the new length of the modified array.
Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def removeElement(nums, val):
    p1 = 0
    p2 = 0

    while p2 < len(nums):
        if nums[p2] != val:
            nums[p1] = nums[p2]
            p1 += 1
        p2 += 1

    return p1

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]
val = 3

new_length = removeElement(nums, val)
print(new_length)  # Output: 2
print(nums[:new_length])  # Output: [2, 2]


```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra memory regardless of the input size.
