The LeetCode problem 1244, "Design a Leaderboard," asks us to design a leaderboard data structure with several operations. Here's the problem statement for reference:

**Problem:** Design a leaderboard class that supports the following operations:
- `void addScore(int playerId, int score)`: Insert a new score for a given player.
- `int top(int K)`: Return the score sum of the top `K` players.
- `void reset(int playerId)`: Reset the score of a player to 0.

The leaderboard will contain at most `10000` players, and the scores range from `0` to `1000`. The operations `top` and `reset` will be called at most `10000` times in total.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of a hash map and a priority queue (or heap). The hash map will store the player IDs and their corresponding scores, and the priority queue will store the top `K` players based on their scores. Let's see the implementation:

```python
import heapq

class Leaderboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scores = {}  # {playerId: score}

    def addScore(self, playerId, score):
        if playerId in self.scores:
            self.scores[playerId] += score
        else:
            self.scores[playerId] = score

    def top(self, K):
        heap = []
        for score in self.scores.values():
            heapq.heappush(heap, score)
            if len(heap) > K:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        return sum(heap)

    def reset(self, playerId):
        del self.scores[playerId]
```

**Time Complexity:**

- The `addScore` operation has a time complexity of O(1) since it only involves inserting or updating a score in the hash map.
- The `top` operation iterates through all the player scores, which takes O(n) time, where n is the number of players. Additionally, maintaining the priority queue of size `K` takes O(n log K) time. Overall, the `top` operation has a time complexity of O(n log K).
- The `reset` operation has a time complexity of O(1) since it only involves deleting a player's score from the hash map.

**Space Complexity:**

- The space complexity of the leaderboard class is O(n), where n is the number of players. This is because we store the player IDs and their scores in the hash map, which can take up to O(n) space in the worst case.

Overall, this design efficiently handles the given operations within the specified constraints, providing an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity.
