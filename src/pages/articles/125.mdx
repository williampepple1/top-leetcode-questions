The "Valid Palindrome" problem on Leetcode is described as follows:

Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Here is a Python solution using two pointers. We will use Python's built-in `isalnum()` function to check if a character is alphanumeric and `lower()` function to convert characters to lower case:

```python
def isPalindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        # Ignore non-alphanumeric characters
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1

        # Compare characters
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        
        # Move towards the center
        left, right = left + 1, right - 1

    return True
```

This solution works by comparing corresponding characters from both ends of the string towards the center. It skips non-alphanumeric characters. If it encounters a pair of characters that are not the same (case insensitive), it returns `False`. If it successfully compares all pairs of characters without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`. 

Please note that the input string `s` is assumed not to be empty or `None`, as per the problem statement.
