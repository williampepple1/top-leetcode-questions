The problem "Min Stack" from LeetCode asks:

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Here's a Python solution using two stacks:

```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min_stack = []

    def push(self, x):
        self.stack.append(x)
        if not self.min_stack or x <= self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.append(x)

    def pop(self):
        if self.stack:
            if self.stack[-1] == self.min_stack[-1]:
                self.min_stack.pop()
            return self.stack.pop()

    def top(self):
        if self.stack:
            return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self):
        if self.min_stack:
            return self.min_stack[-1]
```

In this solution, we use two stacks: `stack` to store all elements and `min_stack` to store the minimum elements.
 When we push an element onto `stack`, if `min_stack` is empty or the element is less than or equal to the top element of `min_stack`, we also push it onto `min_stack`. When we pop an element from `stack`, if it's the same as the top element of `min_stack`, we also pop it from `min_stack`. `top` and `getMin` return the top element of `stack` and `min_stack` respectively.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) for each operation.

This is because we can perform `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin` in constant time. 

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack. 

We use additional space to store the `min_stack`, but it's worth mentioning that in the worst case, when every element is less than or equal to the previous ones, the size of `min_stack` will be equal to the size of `stack`, which makes the space complexity O(n).
