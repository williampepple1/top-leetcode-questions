The problem you're referring to is a question from LeetCode titled "Design Underground System". The problem description is as follows:

>Implement the class UndergroundSystem that supports three methods:
>1. `checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)`
>2. `checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)`
>3. `getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)`

> Each method will be used as follow:

>1. `checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)`: A customer with a card id equal to id, gets in the station stationName at time t.
>2. `checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)`: A customer with a card id equal to id, gets out from the station stationName at time t.
>3. `getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)`: Returns the average time to travel between the startStation and the endStation. The average time is computed from all the previous traveling from startStation to endStation that happened directly.

> Call to `checkIn` and `checkOut` methods is always in chronological order.

We can solve this problem using hash maps in Python. The key to this problem is that the check in and check out of a customer will always be in pairs.

Here is a simple implementation:

```python
class UndergroundSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.check_in_data = {}
        self.journey_data = {}

    def checkIn(self, id: int, stationName: str, t: int) -> None:
        self.check_in_data[id] = [stationName, t]

    def checkOut(self, id: int, stationName: str, t: int) -> None:
        # Look up the check in station and time.
        start_station, start_t = self.check_in_data.pop(id)
        journey = (start_station, stationName)

        # Record journey data.
        if journey not in self.journey_data:
            self.journey_data[journey] = [t - start_t, 1]
        else:
            self.journey_data[journey][0] += t - start_t
            self.journey_data[journey][1] += 1

    def getAverageTime(self, startStation: str, endStation: str) -> float:
        total_time, total_trips = self.journey_data[(startStation, endStation)]
        # Compute average time.
        return total_time / total_trips
```

Time complexity:
- `checkIn` and `checkOut` operations are O(1) because they perform constant-time operations: adding and retrieving a key in a dictionary. 
- `getAverageTime` is also O(1) because it retrieves the time and count from a dictionary and computes the average. 

Space complexity:
- This algorithm uses O(P + S^2) space where P is the number of passengers and S is the number of stations. This is because we use a dictionary to store check-in data for each passenger (O(P)) and a dictionary to store journey data for each pair of stations (O(S^2)). In a worst-case scenario, a passenger could travel between every pair of stations, hence the quadratic term.
