The problem description for LeetCode 1169. Invalid Transactions is:

A transaction is possibly invalid if:

- the amount exceeds $1000, or;
- if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.

You are given an array of strings transactions where `transactions[i]` consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in any order.

Here is a Python solution using a dictionary and list to store transactions for each name:

```python
class Solution:
    def invalidTransactions(self, transactions):
        tx_dict = collections.defaultdict(list)
        res = []
        
        for tx in transactions:
            name, time, amount, city = tx.split(',')
            tx_dict[name].append((int(time), int(amount), city, tx))
            
        for name, txs in tx_dict.items():
            txs.sort()  # sort by time
            
            for i, (time, amount, city, tx) in enumerate(txs):
                if amount > 1000:
                    res.append(tx)
                    continue
                
                if i > 0 and time - txs[i - 1][0] <= 60 and city != txs[i - 1][2]:
                    res.append(tx)
                if i + 1 < len(txs) and txs[i + 1][0] - time <= 60 and city != txs[i + 1][2]:
                    res.append(tx)
                    
        return res
```

In this solution, we first create a dictionary where each key is a name and the corresponding value is a list of transactions for that name. Each transaction is a tuple of time, amount, city, and the original transaction string.

Then we go through each list of transactions, sort them by time, and check each transaction for the two conditions mentioned in the problem. If the amount exceeds $1000, or if it occurs within 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name but a different city, we add the original transaction string to the result.

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity is O(n log(n)) where n is the number of transactions. This is because we sort the transactions for each name. In the worst-case scenario, all transactions are made by the same person and we have to sort all of them.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of transactions. This is because we store all transactions in a dictionary and a list. In the worst-case scenario, all transactions are made by different people and we have to store all of them in the dictionary.
