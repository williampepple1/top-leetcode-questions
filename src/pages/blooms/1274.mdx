The problem 1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle from LeetCode is defined as follows:

On the sea represented by a cartesian plane, each ship is located at an integer point, and each integer point may contain up to 1 ship.

You have a function Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft) which takes two points as arguments and returns a boolean which is true if and only if there is at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the given points, including on the boundary.

Given two points, which are the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle, return the number of ships present in that rectangle. It is guaranteed that there are at most 10 ships in that rectangle.

Submissions making more than 400 calls to hasShips will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For this problem, we use a divide and conquer approach. We split the area into four quadrants and recursively count the ships in each quadrant.

Here's a Python solution assuming `Sea` is a class with a `hasShips` method:

```python
# This is the Sea's API interface.
# You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
# class Sea(object):
#    def hasShips(self, topRight: 'Point', bottomLeft: 'Point') -> bool:

class Solution(object):
    def countShips(self, sea: 'Sea', topRight: 'Point', bottomLeft: 'Point') -> int:
        if not sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft):
            return 0
        if topRight.x == bottomLeft.x and topRight.y == bottomLeft.y:
            return 1

        mid_x = (topRight.x + bottomLeft.x) // 2
        mid_y = (topRight.y + bottomLeft.y) // 2

        return self.countShips(sea, Point(mid_x, mid_y), bottomLeft) + \
               self.countShips(sea, Point(topRight.x, mid_y), Point(mid_x + 1, bottomLeft.y)) + \
               self.countShips(sea, Point(mid_x, topRight.y), Point(bottomLeft.x, mid_y + 1)) + \
               self.countShips(sea, topRight, Point(mid_x + 1, mid_y + 1))
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of ships. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we have to call the `hasShips` method once for each ship, and each call to `hasShips` takes constant time. In practice, the actual number of calls to `hasShips` will be less than n, because we can skip quadrants that don't contain any ships.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of ships. This is because of the recursion stack used in the `countShips` method. The depth of the recursion is proportional to the number of times we can split the area before reaching an area that contains at most one ship, which is log(n).
