The LeetCode problem 1029. Two City Scheduling is as follows:

There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is `costs[i][0]`, and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is `costs[i][1]`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.

We can solve this problem using a greedy approach. Here's how:

1. We first send everyone to city A, so we calculate the total cost.
2. However, we have to send N people to city B. The additional cost of sending the i-th person to city B is `costs[i][1] - costs[i][0]`. So we calculate the additional cost for everyone.
3. We sort the additional costs in ascending order, and sum up the first N additional costs to the total cost. This is because the first N additional costs are the minimum additional costs for sending N people to city B.

Here's the Python code for this solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Calculate the additional cost of sending to city B instead of city A
        diffs = [(B - A, i) for i, (A, B) in enumerate(costs)]
        
        # Sort the additional costs in ascending order
        diffs.sort()
        
        N = len(costs) // 2
        total = 0
        
        # Send the first N people to city A and the rest to city B
        for i in range(len(costs)):
            A = costs[i][0]
            B = costs[i][1]
            
            if i < N:
                total += A
            else:
                total += B
                
        return total
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the differences array. Here, n refers to the total number of people, which is twice the number of people to be sent to each city.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(n) because we store the differences for each person in an array. The maximum size of this array is equal to the total number of people.
