Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

A straightforward approach in Python is to use built-in functions. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def reverseWords(s):
    words = s.split()  # split the string into words
    words.reverse()    # reverse the list of words
    return ' '.join(words)  # join the words back into a string with spaces
```

Let's walk through the function:

1. The `split()` function splits the input string `s` into a list of words. It uses spaces as the delimiter and automatically removes leading, trailing, and consecutive spaces. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `s`, and the space complexity is also O(n), as we store all words in a list.

2. The `reverse()` function reverses the order of words in the list. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1) as it reverses the list in place.

3. The `join()` function joins the words back into a string, separated by single spaces. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n) for the output string.

So, overall, the time complexity of the function is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n).
